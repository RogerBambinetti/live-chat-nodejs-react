## Description

This **LiveChat** project was developed as an interactive chat platform for learning purposes. It includes web version screens that adapt to mobile devices, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience across different devices.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 12.x
- **NPM**: Usually installed with Node.js
- **Git**: To clone the repository

> ⚠️ **Note**: Using other versions may cause incompatibilities.

## Installation & Setup

Instructions on how to install and set up the project.

1. First, let's clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RogerBambinetti/live-chat-nodejs-react.git
cd live-chat-nodejs-react-react-native
```

2. Install the project dependencies with npm:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

3. Set your environment variables correctly in the `.env` file (refer to `.env.example` for guidance)


4. After installing the dependencies, start the server in development mode with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

This command activates development mode with hot-reloading for a more dynamic developing experience.

## Screens and Layout

The layout is responsive and adapts well to both mobile and desktop devices, with four screens available for interaction.
